        <H1>he New Success META</H1>

        <P>There seems to be a new way the young and ambitious are gaining rapid success and achieving 
            their goals. This is an attempt, through simple observation, to de-mystify their success 
            and provide a sort of framework or phases that can be used to duplicate this success. 
            Ultimately this is meant to be used to reverse engineer the methods used for people who 
            are doing less conventional things. Consider this a draft. </P>

        <P>I find it unlikely that the people that followed this approach did so fully intentionally. 
            I think it's more likely that this is the natural progression of these things, however 
            I feel like knowing what's going on in the background better allows one to be intentional 
            about things and maximise their results. 
        </P>

        <P>So, what are the most effective tactics available for finding success as a young and ambitious individual?</P>

        <H2> 1. Be remarkable </H2>
        
        This must be maintained for the entire run, but is also the thing that sparks the journey. Do something praise worthy, do something remarkable. Be part of a venture that already has or will give you that notoriety.

        <H2> 2. Be Recognised</H2>
        ![[recognise.png]]
        From the remarkable work you do, or remarkable person you are naturally people take notice. In some cases your remarkability is all you need to be selected, but most times it requires applying to places that see your greatness. They either reward you, give you a position or admit you to an esteemed program. Recognition comes from different types of [[Influencer patron|influencer patrons]] (Aka a [[benefactor]], this is the type of patron that has notable authority, influence, connections and/or wealth that's able to provide support). These can be an established institute (eg the World Bank or Rhodes University) but can also come from adoring supporters.

        <h2> 3. Be Championed </h2>
        ![[champ.png]]
        The recognition you receive validates your remarkability. Once you're considered valid it's only a matter of time that doors are opened for you. This can either be by some benefactor thrusting you into the lime light or using your new reputation to secure a spot. Regardless of how it's done you must be put in the public, on a pedestal and show the world who you are and what you've done. You are championed by the people who see your greatness.

        <h3> Examples</h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Any and all features in the news</li>
                <li> [[#Nthanda]] being asked to do speaking events (she's done so many)</li>
                <li> [[#Ulemu]] Speaking at Women Deliver Conference in Kigali (via Girl Up)</li>

                <li> [[#Michael]] being a TEDxPSU speaker + being published in the International Affair's Forum</li>
            </ul>   


        <h2> 4. Creating and Seizing Opportunities </h2>
        ![[opportunity.png]]
        All of your work has garnered you credibility, notoriety and relationships so now it's time. Opportunity will be abound throught your journey but none more so than after all this, and some opportunities aren't fully fleshed out and are waiting to be fulluy formed by your hands. Now is the time to use everything to elevate your ventures, to open new opportunities or be promoted to higher heights. 

        <h3> Examples </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> [[#Nthanda]] being promoted to Evaluation Analyst in New York (via UNDP Graduate Programme); Or her founding more organisations </li>
                <li> [[#Ulemu]] getting the Academic Support and Project Coordinator position at University of America</li>
                <li> [[#Upile]] working for VOS; or being invited to the YouthConneckt23 in Kigali</li>
                <li> [[#Michael]] Co-founder: The Business Scholar's Institute (via the McKinsey & Company research grant)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2> 5. Repeat Until You Collapse </h2>
        ![[repeat.png]]
        You can rinse and repeat and flow through these steps in what ever ways feel most natural to you. Studying most of the people you'll see there's no clear step-by-step formula, as it moves from different phases for different people in different ways. The phases can also blur or mix together at times. For example: Michael getting into MBA program at Harvard Business School could be seen as both remarkable and a form of recognition of his work.
